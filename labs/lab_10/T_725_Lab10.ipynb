        "### Answer:\n",
        "1. Pronouns are generally correctly mapped, unfortunately, the major problem is the distance between related words that is more generical problem in NLP and the surrounding context, like verbs and human natural language ambiguity, that are in general not simple to distinguish (in some cases even for humans).\n",
        "2. To correctly map the misinterpreted relations, i had to use the verb, that was for example handy versus lighter, is common to say both a handy bottle and a handy backpack, but in the sentence context seemed more logic to map handy to the backpack, meaning that the backpack without the bottle was easier to carry around.\n",
        "Also, in the last case, AllenNLP fails to map Bill to the pronoun `he`, this may be related to the distance between the two words.\n",
        "Indeed, NLP models in general present the problem of the context window, where if the context window is too small, then too few words are considered, on the other case, if the context window is too wide, the machine may fail to understand the concept.\n",
        "Possibly, in the model, the context window size was set to a specific value that cut out the initial part of the sentence while analysing the pronoun.\n",
        "3. In my opinion, the main ambiguities are related to the natural language itself, as humans we may refere to events or people with a wide list of pronouns and words, the most difficult cases are definitely the ones where subjects are never explicitely stated, for example, two people meeting after some days may continue a conversation and keep referring to things and peoples that were defined in the previous conversation without even mentioning their names.\n",
        "Also, some sentences in natural language are ambiguous, and usually, the meaning is defined by the tone, the expressions and the movement a person is doing, some clear examples are sarcasm or jokes."
